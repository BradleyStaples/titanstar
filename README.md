# TitanStar Legends (Fandom Assignment)

## Developer Notes

Hi! I hope you have as much fun going over this code as I did writing it. A few things to note, in no particular order:

* I didn't make this app responsive. I thought about making the two talent paths go vertical for a smaller device, but in the end decided it was out of scope for this assignment.
* I guessed completely on spacing, font-sizing, etc. I'm used to getting mocks that have annotations in them (via Zeplin or Invision or other tools), so I apologize in advance for any layout differences.
* I couldn't figure out how to do the blue borders around the active icons with the half-gradient, so I did a regular gradient for the border.
* I didn't write tests for my components. This was my first time using react-create-app and I wasn't familiar with its testing stack off the top of my head, and didn't want to add extra hours to the project when it was suggested to only take a few.
* Thanks for looking at my code! - __Bradley Staples__
